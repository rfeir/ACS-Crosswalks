This map is the result of an intersection, union, simplification, and manual edits of two maps supplied by ACS of the MIGPUMA and POWPUMA areas for 2012-2021 and 2022-2031. Some manual edits include adjusting vertices, removing gaps and overlaps by checking area size until finding NJ and DC as smallest legitimate areas. In short, I created a distinct region fo reach overlap and constant region (like California). Averaged variables can then be applied to these "overlap" areas weighted by PWGTP. I summed pre-2022 values and merged onto this file as a df using teh first GISMATCH values and then merged 2022 on the second GISMATCH values. They have been compiled as one variable in this map, but you could separate again using Excel's LEFT or RIGHT command or something similar.
