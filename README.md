# ACS-Crosswalks
Crosswalks for Census Geographies

This Datset currently contains crosswwalks for the 5-Year American Communities Survey Geography Variables. Some of these crosswalks already exist, but others do not. These should allow users to utilize POWPUMAs and MIGPUMAs with PUMA data by setting to a common geography. Additionally, County crosswalks are included. 

The naming conventions of the census are for the 2010 PUMA names to be associated with 2012-2021 and the 2020 PUMA names to be assoiciated with 2022-2031. Since the most recent 5-Year ACS dataset is 2018-2022, only 2022 utilizes the 2020 PUMAs. 

POWPUMAs and MIGPUMAs are the same geographies. Counties completely fit into the County-PUMAs, aka MIGPUMA and POWPUMAs. PUMAs also fit completely into MIGPUMAs and POWPUMAs. So, one can crosswalk/merge their PUMA and County variables into the MIGPUMA Geography.

Connecticut adopted new regions as census equivalencies for the ACS in 2022. Yet, this change from counties to regions has not been enacted in CPS data until 2024. So, These county-equivalencies pose problems for utilizing county-level data.
